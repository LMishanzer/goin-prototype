The band's lineup—consisting of lead vocalist Till Lindemann, lead guitarist Richard Kruspe, rhythm guitarist Paul Landers, bassist Oliver Riedel, drummer Christoph Schneider, and keyboardist Christian \"Flake\" Lorenz—has remained unchanged throughout their history, along with their approach to songwriting, which consists of Lindemann writing and singing the lyrics over instrumental pieces the rest of the band has completed beforehand. Prior to their formation, some members were associated with the punk rock acts Feeling B and First Arsch.",

For most of the band's career they have been a power trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1991). Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Blood Rage, then Sweet Children. They were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut Dookie, released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.",

The group consists of lead singer Alex Turner, drummer Matt Helders, guitarist Jamie Cook and bassist Nick O'Malley. Former bassist Andy Nicholson left the band in 2006 shortly after their debut album was released. Arctic Monkeys were heralded as one of the first bands to come to public attention via the Internet, with commentators suggesting they represented the possibility of a change in the way in which new bands are promoted and marketed. Their debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006), received widespread critical acclaim upon release and topped the UK Albums Chart, becoming the fastest-selling debut album in British chart history at the time. It won Best British Album at the 2007 Brit Awards and has since been hailed as one of the greatest debut albums. The band's second album, Favourite Worst Nightmare (2007), was also acclaimed by critics and won Best British Album at the 2008 Brit Awards. They went on to release Humbug (2009) and Suck It and See (2011), both of which were well-received critically, albeit not to the extent of their first two albums.",

He is a pioneer of trap on the Czech rap scene. Apart from the music genre, he also translates the visual-style culture of American rappers (hairstyles - braids, dreadlocks, facial tattoos, street clothes from leading designers - Gucci, Balenciaga, Louis Vuitton, Prada and others) into the domestic context. He started as DJ Logic in the groups KIDZ, Zutroy Clique and in the controversial Fuerza Arma. He soon adopted rapping to music production and started recording under the pseudonym Logic. During this time, he gradually became known for his mixtape series Player of the Year and also for his mixtape Czech Made Man. In 2015, he co-founded the label Milion+ and released his debut solo album Yzomandias, on which he completed the transformation into the new character Yzomandias. Subsequently, he has released a series of successful albums in the trap genre, Ze dna (2016), Zhora vypadá všechno líp (2017), Sbohem Roxano (2018), Dobrá duše, srdce z zlatata (2019) and Prozyum (2020) and a series of mixtapes J.Eden, J.Eden Dva and J.Eden E-Gen. Most of the albums have received at least platinum certification for sales. Prozyum was awarded the 2020 Angel Genre Award, where it was also nominated for Video of the Year for the video for the single \"Melange\".",
